        FINISHED File to object splitting sequence
        1 - split with "###"

        2 - take the split("###")[res.length - 1] -> for the recent
        
        3 - split with "//"
            
            Now we have : 
            rsplit[0] = the object type name
            replit[1] = the object field value
                
                Note : rsplit is the result of the split with "//"

        4 - save rsplit[0]
    
        5 - split rsplit[1] with ";;"
            
            Now we have all the field
        
        6 - split these "fields" with "=="

            Now we have the field name and type -> [0] and the value -> [1]

        7 - split these "the field name and type -> [0]" with "::" 

            Now we have the field name -> [0] and the field type -> [1]
